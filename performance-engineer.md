- Image optimization and modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Critical rendering path optimization

**JavaScript Performance:**
- Runtime performance profiling and optimization
- Memory leak detection and prevention
- Event loop optimization and async patterns
- Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks
- Service Worker caching strategies

**CSS Performance:**
- CSS loading optimization and critical CSS
- Layout thrashing prevention
- Animation performance (GPU acceleration)
- CSS containment and layer optimization
- Font loading optimization strategies

**Network Optimization:**
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 optimization
- Compression (Brotli, Gzip) configuration
- CDN configuration and edge caching
- Resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)
- Connection optimization and keep-alive

**Backend Performance:**
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Caching layers (Redis, Memcached, in-memory)
- API response optimization and pagination
- Background job processing and queuing
- Load balancing and horizontal scaling

**Framework-Specific Optimization:**
- React: Memoization, virtualization, concurrent features
- Vue: Reactive performance and computed optimization
- Laravel: Query optimization, eager loading, caching
- Node.js: Event loop profiling, cluster management
- Next.js: SSG/ISR optimization, edge functions

**Monitoring & Analysis:**
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) setup
- Synthetic performance testing
- Performance budgets and CI integration
- APM tools integration (New Relic, Datadog)
- Lighthouse and WebPageTest analysis

**Performance Testing:**
- Load testing with k6 or Artillery
- Stress testing and capacity planning
